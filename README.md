# Formula 1 Blog

This project is a blog about Formula 1 developed in Vue.js using the Tailwind css framework.
It contains Big Articles, Small Articles, Driver Cards, Team Cards, Track Cards and many more.
The style is pretty simple, however pretty expandable, it's relatively easy to add new track
into the site, or driver, team or any other article.
